    <h1 class="text-center">About Logistic Model</h1>
    <p>Logistic model was developed by Belgian mathematician Pierre Verhulst (1838) who suggested that the rate of population increase may be limited, i.e., it may depend on population density :</p>
    <p class="text-center"><strong>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = r Z<sub>n</sub> (1 - Z<sub>n</sub>)</strong>, where <strong>r</strong> is the Rate and <strong>Z<sub>n</sub></strong> is the concentration of <strong>n</strong><sup>th</sup> year.
    <br />
    <p>It is said that, this equation governs almost all the density (population, growth, etc.) in the universe. The curve generated on basis of the input parameters have some certain variations.</p>
